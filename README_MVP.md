Dessert API Capstone Project for Thinkful

Hello! This is my MVP for my Dessert API.
My boyfriend and I both have a sweet tooth, and are always looking for desserts to either make ourselves or find nearby.
This app gives you the option to either make something at home or find a place nearby that sells what you are craving.

I use two APIs: Four Square's Places API & Edamame's Recipe API. 
I had originally wanted to use Yelp's API, but they appear to be very strict with how their data was presented.
I played around with Google and FourSquare, and ended up using FourSquare.

There is currently no styling (obviously, lol) but I'm working on it now!
