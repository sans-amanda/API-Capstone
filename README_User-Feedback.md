# API-Capstone
Dessert API Capstone Project for Thinkful

I asked two friends of mine to play around in my app.
The feedback I got was mostly about clunky functions and features that would be nice add-ons.

Mainly, I need an end function to clear their last results! (DOH!) So working on that now.
They also both mentioned that load times were long and so they weren't sure if the clicking worked,
so hopefully I can add some sort of transition (CSS? Jquery?) between button clicks to let the user
know that something is happeneing.

Some addons they would like were distance from current location (not available on FourSquare API, that
I can see) and ingredient lists. I don't think I'll be adding that in for the final project, but
it might be something I want to work on later on the side.

I need to add a .catch error to both the API functions, just in case they try searching a city
instead of a zip, or there search returns no results.
